# Short-Dark-Triad-Test

The Dark Triad is a personality test that explores the socially undesirable traits of machiavellianism (manipulative attitude), narcissism (excessive self-love), and psychopathy (lack of empathy). 

The goals of this project are the following:
*  Identify which itemâ€™s response underwent faking.
*  Reconstruct the honest response given the faked response.

In the present work, we evaluate two datasets with the answers of participants that took the Short Dark Triad 3 test:
*  Study 1: participants of JI group were told that they were going through a job interview (JI) that they cared a lot for and should represent themselves in a good way.
*  Study 2: participants of CC group received the instructions of completing a personality questionnaire imaging to be a parent that was undergoing a cause for the 
custody of his/her children (CC), and therefore, they had to show to be the best parent.

The full dataset description and detailed SDT test exlanation can be found in the FP_CBSD.ipynb Jupyter Notebook which includes in depth explanations and code implemented.
